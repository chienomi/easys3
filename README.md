# Easys3

Putting files to S3 & getting files from S3 should be one liner. In reality, you might be confused with tricky behavior of official `aws-sdk` gem. With `easys3`, `Easys3.put(bucket_name, file_name, file, acl)` means putting files to s3 and `Easys3.get(bucket_name, file_name)` means getting a file from s3.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'easys3'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install easys3
